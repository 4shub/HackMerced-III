# HackMerced

Welcome to HackMerced's primary git repository. If you are making any change to any project that deals directly with anything this team works on, please use this as your development environment!

This readme serves to provide you with general information about HackMerced development, production and release. For more detailed information, please check out our [wiki](https://github.com/HackMerced/HackMerced/wiki/Creating-an-instance-of-HackMerced).


## Preface
### Why one repository?
We believe that development is best done with all of your tools already present at disposal. Many times come while we're developing, we find an issue or idea for somewhere else. What better a solution to both preventing bugs and easing a development process than it is to create a mono-repo. We found that using a mono-repo keeps everyone on track and on page in development, from our backend to frontend team - no one is left out of development as they are perfectly in the know when something they make breaks something else.

### Component Distribution
There are many tools in the HackMerced toolchain that we would love to share with everyone else! Not everyone needs to download all of HackMerced to use a simple javascript plugin or an example of how to use react. All of our distributable packages are available on the rest of HackMerced's Github. Be sure to pull from those if you really want to work with them since most development on this branch could have breaking changes!

The following is a list of "distributables" that originate from this package:
* [Admit](https://github.com/hackmerced/admit) v0.2.0
* [Tomoe](https://github.com/hackMerced/Tomoe) v1.0.0
* [Myriagon](https://github.com/hackmerced/myriagon) v0.5.0

## Creating your environment
While HackMerced utilizes a mono-repository it is not required that you set up every environment for developing on HackMerced. Please use the following guides to set up what you want to build with HackMerced:

## Understanding each project
Every project in this repository has it's own readme about specific project based information. This can range from API information to finer grained installation instructions.

## Quality Assurance and Testing
HackMerced is trying to get better at this!
